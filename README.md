Here , in this project, I have first of all made the histograms and tried to see the distribution of the datasets. As we can see from the dataset, the data is normally distributed and hence can be used for regression analysis. Now, we also try to plot the box whisker plot which shows us the difference if that particular feature  was present or absent and what would be its result on the patient. I did make some failed attempts to remove the unused rows of data such as one with 0 BMI and other which had 0 Age e.t.c. I then have made two models namely the logistic regression and the decision tree of which the logistic regression won.
